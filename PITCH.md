# RugMania — One-Pager Pitch

## 🎯 The Problem

Web3 gaming has a trust problem. Most blockchain games suffer from:

- **Opaque Outcomes** — Players can't verify if game results are fair or manipulated
- **Unsustainable Economics** — Rewards funded by new player deposits (ponzi mechanics)
- **Fragmented Experience** — Gaming and DeFi exist in silos with no integration
- **User Friction** — Complex wallet setups drive away mainstream users

The $200B+ global gaming market is moving on-chain, but players need games they can actually trust.

## 💡 The Solution: RugMania

RugMania is a **provably fair, high-stakes survival game** built natively on Mantle Network.

**How it works:**
1. Connect your wallet (seamless via Privy — no MetaMask popups)
2. Place a bet and choose difficulty (3, 4, or 5 doors)
3. Pick a door each level — safe door advances you with multiplier, rug door ends the game
4. Cash out anytime or risk it all for up to **57x returns**

**What makes it different:**
- **Provably Fair** — Commit-reveal cryptographic scheme. Server seed hash is committed before play, revealed after. Every outcome is verifiable on-chain.
- **DeFi-Integrated Rewards** — House profits are deployed into Mantle's DeFi ecosystem (Mantle Vault, mETH). Yields distributed weekly to top leaderboard players.
- **Frictionless UX** — Instant wallet creation, in-app deposits, no seed phrases.

## 💰 Business Model

**Revenue Stream:** 5% house edge on all winnings

**Allocation:**
- 60% → Mantle Yield Pool (deployed to Mantle DeFi for player rewards)
- 30% → Operations & Development
- 10% → Treasury

**Sustainability:** Unlike ponzi-style games, our rewards come from real DeFi yields, not new player deposits.
